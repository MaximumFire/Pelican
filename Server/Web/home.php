            <h2>Our Goals</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project is to produce a private chatting application with similar functionality to other popular sites such as discord or teams. The project is still under developement and will hopefully remain updated until a complete product is formed.</p>

            <h2>Benefits of Pelican</h2>
            <p>Pelican is being made to allow higher levels of customisation when compared to other industry standard applications. It is unlikely that there will be any performance increases however you will have the ability to mould your account to your personal liking.</p>
